Springtime in Michigan ðŸŒ¸

This project showcases a multi-page website that I developed as part of a CSS course. The website is themed around "Springtime in Michigan," specifically focusing on the beauty of Ann Arbor during the spring season.

Features:

*Navigation: A fixed, centered navigation bar makes it easy to explore the different sections of the site, including home, neighborhood walks, and walks in the park.
*Image Gallery: Each page features a grid-based gallery of images with smooth hover effects, enhancing the visual experience.
*Custom Styling: I used CSS to style the header, footer, main content, and images, focusing on creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look.
*External Resources: The project integrates external resources such as  Bootstrap for enhanced functionality and styling.


Pages:

1-Home: Introduction to the site, highlighting springtime in Ann Arbor and featuring a link to the main content.
2-Neighborhood Walks: A collection of photos capturing the beauty of spring in local neighborhoods.
3-Parks: Showcases various parks and natural areas in Michigan, complete with scenic images.
